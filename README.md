Nowadays, many teens and young adults overlook their health while constantly chasing academic or career success. We've seen it firsthand, countless friends dealing with neck and back pain from long study sessions or hours spent hunched over laptops in the library. We wanted to change that. After conducting market research, we found this issue is widespread among students and young professionals. When looking at competitors like Upright Go 2, we noticed a gap: their product works well, but it mainly targets older adults. The design isn't appealing to younger users, and the interface feels clunky and outdated. That's where our idea comes in, a portable, stylish posture tracking necklace designed specifically for teens and young adults. It's lightweight, easy to use, and connects to an app that gives users real-time posture feedback and monthly insights to help them track their progress. Our goal is to make good posture effortless and fashionable, turning health awareness into something people actually want to wear every day.
